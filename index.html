      aims to show (fashion / culture and icons) as reality. It was originally started as a magazine (THE REALITY SHOW) directed by Tiffany Godoy and Tomoyuki Yonezu. A new project started this year to create software that converts daily movies taken by iPhone to a creative film. We're exploring methodologies to connect digital world and the reality.
